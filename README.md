# Interface_vibration

Typically presence of interfaces increses a system energy. This is why a system tendds to reduce amount of interfaces to become more homogeneouse. In his particular problem a domain with an oposite polarizatin is sandwitch between two big domains. Although a system is metastable, the domain with opoiste polarization can dissapear with time.
The following model assumes that the multidomain state dissapear when the neighboring domain bridge because of thermal fluctuations. Thus we need to describe probability of two domains to bridge over the oposite domain.
The following code implements that model to fit simulations data and extract valuable paramteres of the system depending on how fast domains collapses.
